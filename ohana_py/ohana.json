He packed up his entire life in Oregon where he grew up and shipped everything that mattered to him over to Maui to start his new chapter. That chapter started roughly when our dad unexpectedly passed away a week after he moved to Hawaii. Shaun began his wedding planning business after returning from Oregon (for our dad's celebration of life) and worked at Foodland Farms in Lahaina before getting a job with HFA (distributing food to stores in Lahaina). When covid hit in 2020, the wedding planning business was put on hold (since no tourists were allowed for so long). Shaun and Laura met in March 2019. Laura had been on Maui for years and is very loved by many in the theater community and works at local schools as a teacher (4th grade the last two years).

I never thought I would ever have to do this, but I am starting this gofundme to humbly ask for your help. Our family has been affected by the wildfire that devastated my beloved hometown of Lahaina, Maui on August 8, 2023. Our family home was destroyed in the fire. Our 90 year-old mother Natividad Pascual barely escaped with her life. But thanks to God and many angels, she is still alive and staying here with me in Wailuku. My brother Macario and his family, Karen, Nick and Evan are safe but sheltering at home in Honokowai. They’ve been without power, and phone and cell service have been sporadic since Tuesday. My Mom was evacuated to the Lahaina Civic Center shelter, where she was seen by EMTs for her eye injuries and small burns from the flying embers and ash. There, she was able to be transported by ambulance to Maui Memorial Medical Center where I was able to reunite with her at 3 a.m. Thank God. We truly believe that our Dad in Heaven was protecting our Mom. The Pascual roots are firmly planted in Lahaina and we will never leave. We hope to one day enjoy the bounty from the marungay tree that my Dad planted back in 1969. The base of the tree still appears to be there – I am confident that it will recover as will our family and all of Lahaina. We appreciate anything you can give. Mahalo and thank you!"

Many of my 2nd and 3rd cousins are like brothers and sisters to me. When situations like these happen, it's only natural for our family to come together to help support our loved ones. My aunty, Kanoe Keahi, lived across the street from the Lahaina Cannery, about a neighborhood over from Lahainaluna road. Her house, like so many others, was decimated in flames. Her dog wasn't able to get out and all they have are the clothes on their backs and they are currently houseless. With that being said, this go fund me is dedicated to her and her Ohana to help on this long road of rebuilding their lives. Full transparency, money raised here will be given directly to her. I've already started collecting donations of all sorts to send help directly to our family currently stuck in Lahaina. Friends of mine were generous enough to donate monetarily and I've personally collected nearly $1800 and counting via Venmo, that will be donated directly to my Aunty to help in getting her and her family clothes and necessities and long term help to get their lives figured out."

Chuck is in his mid 70s and suffers from diabetes that can affect his mobility. We are so grateful that he survived when so many did not. However, he's lost his home, possessions and vehicle to the flames.Many want to help and Chuck is so grateful. He's loves Maui and does not want to leave. Thankfully, he has temporary shelter with a friend but will only be able to stay there for so long. Our family's hope is that these funds will help him start to replace and rebuild what has been lost and he can stay on the island he loves.All funds raised will go directly to Chuck. If you prefer to give in another way, please reach out to myself, my uncle Michael or my dad Henri."

My name is Bobi Cuddihy and my brother Sanford Hill lost everything but the clothes on his back and his car in the Lahaina wildfire. Especially hard for him to lose was a lifetime of photography. Sanford is a kama'aina (born and raised in Hawaii). He moved to Maui in 1972, as a 20-year-old, when it was an undiscovered remnant of old Hawaii and before Lahaina became a tourist destination. Sanford is resilient and has the ho’omau (ability to persevere) but at his age it isn’t easy to start all over. He didn’t have much and doesn’t need much. He was living just on social security and in the senior low-income housing. But the cost of starting over in Hawaii is high. Your kindness, generosity, and Aloha to this GoFundMe campaign will go directly towards providing Sanford with the essentials – a safe shelter, clothing, food, and the means to start anew. Every dollar raised will play a crucial role in making a difference in rebuilding his life."

My family is one of those families currently seeking any help possible. My parents came into this country with absolutely nothing and have worked hard for everything they had. Unfortunately our home isn’t livable anymore, and our business took some damage. My family was only able to leave with a small box of trinkets. The money from this gofundme will be used to help my family to get back on their feet. Any amount helps immensely and we’ll forever be thankful! Also if you can’t donate we ask to please share on your social media pages or with friends and family."

Amber was born and raised in Lahaina and George has lived here for 35 years. The town they have lived in and loved dearly has been reduced to a pile of rubble. Between them, they’ve worked at Hula Grill, Kimo’s, Merriman’s and Hard Rock Café. If you have been to any of those places, they've probably made or served your drinks. Their house is/was located a few blocks from Lahaina Luna at the base of the historic Sugar Mill Camp. If you want to donate directly to a family, rather than a corporate entity, please do so here.

Aisha along with other family were evacuating to the area known as ‘front street’, which ended up being traumatizing overall. There were cars everywhere, people running, and overall mass havoc. The skies were dark, and everyone was unable to make clear decisions due to the nature of the event. At this time, they all went into fight or flight mode and had to do what they needed to do to survive. They were able to successfully flee. As a family they were able to detour and find a way out of Lahaina and the burning area within a safe amount of time…. meaning minutes. I humbly ask on behalf of Aisha and Alisi for your contribution to help them get back on their feet, to allow aisha to be able to purchase a car as her vehicle burned in the fire, to get a roof over their heads, to allow for various essential items in which are needed to comfortably survive."

His sacrifice to be in an environment with limited food, water, electricity and service for his loved ones is one of the reasons I am making this account for him, my mom, and my younger siblings to find peace and comfort during this difficult time.

She evacuated with the clothes on her back and a small bag of things. She moved to Maui at the age of 16 with her older brother working hard and earning money for their dad and brother back in Mexico. Jimena, her brother Christian, and her grandmother are such hard workers. In the process of attempting to help her family she lost the room her and her grandmother lived together in, the life she had before. I’m making this gofundme on her behalf. She was supposed to be attending her senior year of high school by this time instead she is stuck in Napili with limited phone service and trying to face her reality that her home, savings and everything is gone. With all your help i’m hoping to raise enough to put her and her family back on their feet. "

My 92 year old mother, Wanda Kitaguchi (pictured in cover photo), was one of the many who lost their home. Left behind was all of her belongings (with the exception of a few essentials/couple pairs of clothes). She evacuated at the last minute alongside my daughter who also left home with close to nothing. It pains me to say that my brother who also resided with them there, Albert Kitaguchi, has still not been located since the night of 8/8. In efforts to look for my brother, my daughter drove through active fire/power lines/thick black smoke with little visibility on two separate occasions the night of the fire, and watched our home engulfed in flames. My mother, Wanda Kitaguchi, immigrated from Japan to Lahaina in 1953, alongside my Lahaina born father, James S. Kitaguchi (departed). So many memories, so much blood, sweat, and tears, countless irreplaceable family photo albums and memorabilia, journals upon journals of daily logs that my mom would write every evening, all of her \"broke da mouth\" recipes she has spent her whole life collecting from different people and places, gone into the ashes and rubble before they even knew it. Beyond the material things, our Wahikuli home held so much more meaning, history, and depth. Funds earned will go toward providing basic essential items, hotel stay costs, and potentially reestablishing their home in the far future."

My brother, his girlfriend and their dog were woken up from the smoke, flames and screams. Very confused and scared, they tried to get out of the area as fast as possible, but were met in gridlock with other vehicles. They barely made it out of the area alive. With no gas and damage to their van, they walked to kaanapali until they kept being told to move out towards Honokowai. They waited for days with no help. With no sleep, food and barely any water, they made a desperate decision to go back on foot to siphon gas from abandoned cars so they could hopefully drive back out to town. There was no warning that the fires were spreading quickly and we’re thankful that they are ok. "

Jac and Andrew bought their home with every penny they had at a young age because they knew they wanted to grow a family in Lahaina. They rolled up their sleeves together, literally, and over the years spent hundreds of hours personally making the house into a \"home.\" After many years of slowly renovating and budget rebuilding, all while growing their family (having 3 children) they finally reached a point where they were comfortable and not sleeping in a construction zone. They entertained visitors and shared their space with many friends and co-workers. They planted a garden, raised chickens, hosted their children's birthdays, and shared the special memories of family life in Lahaina. Their sense of respect and community pride, appreciation for the culture, and knowledge of the land/ocean is astounding. Although Andrew and Jaclyn are safe and surrounded by family and support, I set up this Crowdfund for them, as they are too emotional at the moment. I know they are humble and I know they will use any funds to support themselves,\rtheir children, and/or the community in Lahaina. Their goal right now is to hang on to their burned land without having to foreclose in hopes to rebuild the \"home,\" not the house."

My parents lived in south Lahaina on Front st, with our two loving sweet yellow labradors Molly & Dakota. They are mom and daughter ages 9 & 5. My mom ran a wonderful business from home supplying families in need with baby items which is what brought her to Lahaina. She was previously living in Makawao but moved to Lahaina due to how well her business was doing on the west side. The morning the fires broke out my mom was doing business in Kahului trying to get baby seats to a visiting family. They were trying to rush home, but when they reached the Maui ocean center they were met with road closures and traffic making it impossible to get home. They had to sleep on the side of the road & our dogs were home all alone. They were trying to get ahold of neighbors to grab the dogs before evacuating but there was no luck due to cell towers being down. We are really hoping that they got rescued and made it out safely but we will not know until everything is okay to return too. We still have gotten no word whether or not they are safe and are trying to remain hopeful. My parents lost everything, clothes, medicine, food, pictures, and so much more. 100% of the money raised will be going towards my parents to aid them with the rescue of our dogs, medicine, clothing, food, and basic essentials they need."

They are currently displaced and mourning the loss of their home and cat, Malu. They owned a scuba diving business called Banyan Tree Divers for 10 years. Together with their rock star team of five other instructors (who also lost everything in the fire), they shared the beauty of Maui underwater with many people. Their business also helped spread the message of ocean conservation and local activism. This was their first home. They have opened that home and their hearts to so many of us. They would truly give the shirts off their backs to anyone in need. Please, if you can, help this family get back on their feet!"

The revered Fleming home Trinity shared with her ohana (roomies Luca, Ronnie, Micah, Jake, Leonard, Kala, and Zuzu) was burned to the ground by the Lahaina, Maui wildfires on the evening of August 8, 2023. Like so many others, Trinity lost everything, including her cherished surfboards and other seafaring equipment, furniture, clothing, shoes, bicycle, electronics, toiletries, vital record documents, etc.\r With the exception of her car, the clothes on her back, and a few donations she has since received, everything Trinity owned is gone. We are very lucky to have Trinity safe and with us today. For the past two years, she has dedicated her life to managing and growing the LahAina Surf Shack. Trinity considers her surf instructors, students, and their families as her ohana (family). Trinity coordinated and supported the families of the keiki (children's) programs at the surf shop; she also served as a community organizer for beach cleanups. Trinity has been part of the convoys transporting resources around the island, and as of Saturday, August 12, 2023 Trinity is now volunteering with the Red Cross in their community centers. She is also working to organize an ice pack exchange so that all of those displaced will have a way to keep their coolers cold. Maui is Trinity's life; there is nowhere else she calls home. Immediate needs include housing, a new laptop, and a surfboard - much needed for mental health!"

We are still on the search for their other cat, Baby. Their greatest need right now is basic things like clothing, toiletries, food, gas, etc. Kat also lost her business, Pomaika'i Therapeutic Massage. She ran her business out of her home. She is a 5 star massage therapist who loves her clients and brings much healing to them. She’s an amazing mom to her 2 children, Mahina (9) and Aharon (18). George is an amazing dad, well known and loved on the island and grew up in Lahaina. Together as a family with God, they will start a new chapter."

At a full house of 10 there was always a lot of life here, a lot of memories made, a lot of memories kept. This was a home and a promise of a new life in America. This was a place to come home to at the end of the day, a place to stay, talk story, and sing karaoke with family, a place to celebrate birthdays and graduations, a place to be together and mourn the loss of loved ones, a place to play with all the family pets, a place to cook and enjoy delectable home cooked meals, and yes during Covid this was a place for school too. This home was full of life. Please, we are asking for help for the whole family to get back up on their feet, to begin again."

In 2018 he was awarded the \"Maui Peace Hero\" award for his selfless service to the community of Maui. Not only has he donated his time, talent, energy and resources for the greater good of Maui throughout his past 40+ years of residency, but has also served our country in the US Navy.

            "description": "Recently a devastating fire has swept through the island of Maui destroying completely the town of Lahaina. The gravity of the situation is immense and tragic, striking all members of the community. In particular, my brother, Jordan, his wife, Tiff, and 1 year old son, Milo were victims of this fire. Luckily all three of them are safe but their whole possessional life has been lost to the fire. The fire not only burned through their neighborhood but burned to the harbor where my brother worked on numerous boats, destroying his entire work. His office, workshop, and his boats have been consumed by the fire. Additionally, his wife who is a professional photographer is now jobless too as the fire has halted tourism and most of her equipment was consumed in the fire. They now must find a way to provide for themselves and their young son, jobless and without a home to return to. Everything has been lost but two suitcases and their lives. The few words here can not fully encompass the devastation that has occurred. The funds raised here will go directly to them, helping to stabilize themselves amid the instability and insecurity disaster brings, as they navigate rebuilding their lives. All financial donations are appreciated along with prayers."

On August 8, 2023, the wildfires of West Maui decimated my childhood home and the house of my grandmother, Joyce Ige, and my parents, Troy and Diane Pasion. The house was erected in the mid-1950s by my late grandfather, Takeo, and it has been the humble home of my family ever since then. In the efforts to evacuate the house promptly, we were unable to secure anything else besides our family members (three elderly and two dogs, as well as my mother, father, and I). In that process, we were unable to secure any personal belongings and were forced to flee Lahaina with little more than the clothes on our backs. If you can find it in your heart, my family and I are asking for your generosity today. Anything you give will be helping us to subsidize the cost of living while we try to navigate the uncertain times that lie before us."

They were only able to grab their dog Ziya, a bike, and each other before they had to leave their home. Unfortunately, we just received confirmation that their condo complex, was lost in the raging fires that destroyed this historic neighborhood. Currently, Rachael will be out of work as the tourism industry in her area will be deeply affected by the fires, and as a photographer, Rachael relied on tourists who have her capture their special moments, from engagements & weddings to surf lessons and family portraits. Nicole will be unable to support her clients due to the impact of the devastation and having to rebuild. She is unsure if she will have capacity to work.

She is the best mom to her two sweet boys Teo and Taj.  Heidi herself lost her small business and therefore her income. By some miracle her house is standing, but most of the neighborhood was devastated, it may be weeks before the house can be assessed to be determined if will be livable or will need restoration, not to mention the impact to the power and plumbing infrastructure of that neighborhood. The funds will be used for all necessities as she made it out with her children and a few important papers and the clothes on their back, and additionally paying for housing while they are displaced and no income from the business."

Jake and Melissa both grew up playing sports and played for their alma mater Lahainaluna High School. If you're lucky enough to know this 'ohana personally, you know that you will never leave their company without sore cheeks from smiling and laughing the entire time. They are some of the most genuine and kind-hearted people I know.Our families were all raised together. We spent many days wreaking havoc in Wahikuli and driving our parents crazy.

Visitors and locals alike would come through the shop to talk stories, hang out with friends, and learn to surf. Sometimes just to grab a board and paddle out at Breakwall. Kyle took over the business in 2018, and built a culture that prioritized community, caring and friendship. Folks would come from all over and learn to surf with teachers who practice Aloha in every way. When the fires came on August 8, 2023, there was no preparation for the devastation. The shop- ironically an historic building, the old fire station- burned to the ground and reduced to ash. From aerial photos it is clear nothing survived. The employees have lost everything. Most are now homeless and now have lost their livelihoods for the time being. We are thankful that all employees have been accounted for, it is going to be a long road of rebuilding. We learned that Kyle does not have property insurance. He is applying for every federal loan available, but it is not enough. We are devastated that our beloved shop is gone. Any help is so appreciated."

I am the niece of Sione Fehoko and my family & I are creating this fundraiser for his family. My uncle’s family was heavily impacted by the destructive Maui wildfires in Lahaina on 8/08/23. My uncle cannot be present at the moment for his family, which in turn has his wife, his elderly father-in-law, and 6 daughters in solitude during these trying times. My uncle’s family consists of Heilala (wife), Salome (21), Ma’asi (17), Sela (16), Sophie (15), Leinala (9), Linita (4), and his father-in-law, Taniela Hala (72). Their home was not only home to their family but was seen as a safe space for many of those in the Tongan community living in Lahaina; especially those a part of the STT Maui church.The funds will be transferred directly to Heilala Fehoko via the GoFundMe beneficiary method. Heilala has been added as the beneficiary of this account so that she can determine how the funds will be used."

All my people on the island have lost everything overnight from their homes to their small businesses. I write this with a heavy heart asking for any assistance anyone may be able to provide. I grew up skating down Lahaina Luna Rd. Going to Badass Coffee on Front St. and cruising down to KP's I went to King Kamehameha Elementary and Children of the Rainbow when I use to live in Lahaina Surf apartments. Growing up on the island was a blessing and now all my childhood memories will forever live on in memory. I want to donate all of the money raised to help my friends and family rebuild their lives. I don't physically live on the island anymore, yet Lahaina will forever be home. Mahalo!"

We have been sleeping in the car the past couple nights. So many in my town lost our homes. We don't have access to housing because there was already a severe shortage of homes in my town. Some of my family members can't go back to work because they lost their workplaces too in the fire. The funds will be used to replace what we lost in the fire. We lost all our clothes, belongings, furniture, kitchen and bathroom things, even important documents. My grandma lost her car that melted in the fire. Please, every little bit helps.

Their family home of 55 years was destroyed by the ravaging wildfire that tore through the beautiful town of Lahaina. Uncle Remy, Royale and Randal evacuated quickly and sadly had to leave all of their possessions behind. They were also forced to make the heartbreaking decision to leave behind their family pets that included 9 cats (Chong, Shadow, Ghost, Whisper, Stoney, Meanie, Goldie, Tiny and Nanu), 8 chickens and 2 lovebirds (Rocky and Adrian). If you know our Maui family you know that they are always the life of the party, where at any time any one of them can tell the funniest story, makes us laugh with crazy jokes or entertain us with beautiful voices. We understand that many across the island of Maui are dealing with the devastation so any donation given is greatly appreciated. The funds raised will help provide the family with the means to purchase groceries and all other necessities for day-to-day living.

This is a difficult time for many that will need to rebuild from scratch. Thank you to those who have reached out in any of the ways. Through some of these correspondences we received requests to set up a GoFundMe to be able to provide Joy and Mike with some assistance. Joy is currently in the hospital suffering from burns and smoke inhalation recieved while waiting for aid from first responders. She watched her car explode and was pelted by glass and shrapnel while in the rough ocean that evening evading the heat from the devastation unfolding before her eyes. This was not an easy feat as she is recovering from recent spinal fusion surgery. Mike had been helping the Napili Point deal with the severe winds when he received the news of the extreme happenings in Lahaina. Putting a financial number on this trama is impossible! Anything you can do to help them rebuild is Most Appreciated!!"

She is one among many who have lost their home, job and livelihood in the structure fire's devastation. Many community members were forced to evacuate their homes with only a few minutes or less to prepare. I am so grateful Emma is safe and non-injured, as she has been visiting me off-island, but it was a long night of no contact with neighbors and friends whose powerlines were destroyed in the fire's wake. We received little-to-no update until very late, only to find out her entire island hometown of Lahaina had been completely burned to ash. She will return with no house, no clothes, no car and a loss of momentos and memories. I'm hoping to source direct funds from the community, family members and friends in order to help Emma replace, rebuild and find ease as she navigates her return home to this tragic loss that has left her with nothing. All money donated will go directly to Emma."

My family has been in Lahaina since 1994 after my parents immigrated from the Phillippines to seek a better life in the U.S. After 30 years of supporting my siblings and me through long hours of arduous back-breaking work in the tourism industry, this disaster has left them without a home, taking everything from our beloved backyard garden to the mailbox at the end of our driveway. They had been so proud to be able to afford a house that they could call theirs, that would serve as a place for so many family reunions for me, my siblings (Len, Nelson, and Rhon) and our young families. Just four months ago we were visiting the people and places that shaped me into who I am today. Those places no longer exist. My mom, Leony, my dad, Leo, and my brother's partner, Haley, were living in the home before the fire and now are left without a place to call home. This nightmare is something we could have never imagined.Any amount that you can contribute will go directly to getting my heartbroken family back on their feet and rebuilding our family home. We thank you from the bottom of our hearts."

Many of my Arconado family members started at this very house. We are relieved that all family members in this household are alive and well. Help is needed to kickstart back on their feet. Anything truly helps. We love you to the bottom of our hearts. Mahalo."

I am extremely grateful that their family of 5 are safe and unharmed but tragically, they have lost not only their house but their livelihoods. Our family has been a part of the Lahaina community for over 30 years, owning a small jewelry shop on Front St for most of that time. Sadly, we had to give up that storefront during the pandemic, and my aunt moved to running her business out of her home. With less than an hour to evacuate, their family was only able to grab their most valuable possessions, leaving behind clothing, merchandise, supplies, documents, and much more. Still recovering from the recent loss of my grandmother who lived with them and anticipating large upcoming college tuition costs for their eldest son, my aunt and her family were already in a tight financial position. It will be a long journey to recovery, so we are asking for donations to help them get back on their feet."

Had we not done this, we would have been among the many people that had to abandon their cars and jump into the ocean for safety. Since coming to Wailuku, photos show that our home and town has turned to rubble. We are grateful to be alive and reunite with my grandparents, whom we didn't locate until a day later. However, we can only fend for ourselves with the money we have in our pockets and banks for so long. The more days that pass, the more our survival becomes a financial burden. Please consider donating any ounce of money to our family. This will go towards hopefully rebuilding our house (whenever that is possible), repurchasing valuables lost in the fire, pet food and supplies, and other necessary items. Thank you for all of the prayers, thoughts, phone calls, and texts. We sincerely appreciate it."

They live in the heart of Lahaina where Dave, Nic, and Thorpe worked at Waikiki Brewing on Front Street. Dave was the executive head chef there, putting his heart and soul into creating the menu from the ground up, and embracing the island foods while adding his own Colorado flare. It was a labor of love that was caught in this horrific event on Wednesday. Melissa has lived on the islands for over ten years and currently works with the Maui, Molokai, and Lanai schools in special education with an emphasis in working with deaf and hard of hearing children often traveling between all three islands. If you know these two, you are aware of how they embody aloha. Friends for almost 20 years, I’ve worked with Melissa, lived with her, and she has become an auntie to my children and pets. They are the kindest and most deserving individuals we know and she would give the shirt off her back for a friend or stranger. Now that they need our help, it’s time to give all that we can to help them get back on their feet and get back to work. Our hearts are broken but we know that this community can come together and rebuild. All funds raised will be given directly to Melissa, Dave, Nic and Thorpe to rebuild their lives and get their animals to safety. Mahalo."

At first we were kind of happy (no school means family day and we’d like to grab those opportunities every time they appear, so it was time for some monopoly and tacos, and then we smell the smoke, and everything just flipped. To be able to describe our exodus (and I use biblical words because it’s was really biblical) I would have to remember and right now the best thing is moving forward. We’re safe thank god, with health and most important part we’re together. Now as we tried to recoup and balance our wins and looses we just realized that we might be out of resources kind of quick. So like my dad use to said: it takes courage to be able to realize that sometimes you need help, and even more courage to ask for it."

We also ask for our Twin girls Stella and Luna age 5 who we will also need to buy school supplies and clothing, footwear. And most inpostantly food and drinking water. Any help even if it's a dollar will greatly help us get what our children need until we figure out what our other next steps to take will be. I truly thank you all for any monetary donation or even for just sharing our gofundme. Thank you truly and we greatly appreciate it.

She asked if they can come to my house. And without hesitation I said come!!! And with the grace of god they are all accounted for and safe. They've lived and serviced Lahaina, Maui for more than 23 years. Proud church members. They are people that give and expect nothing in return. They are left without a home to return to.

She was able to grab her phone and wallet but left with only the clothes on her back. They were able to escape by car to the bypass but when the fires got too close they were told to leave by police. Unfortunately the car wouldn't start and they were forced to run by foot from the thick black clouds and crazy winds. Thankfully a stranger picked her up and drove her to Wailuku where she is staying with a friend. I know there are so many resources and amazing people donating clothes and food but my mom is in America with a green card and it is critical that she get a new passport. So the money donated will be used for basic necessities as well as making sure she is able to get her paperwork in order."

I am already overwhelmed by the number of people from all over who are asking how they can help. Let's love on this family who love and care for everyone they encounter.Thank you in advance. I will try to update as often as I can."

This home you see in the picture…. that is no longer a home. That home that is now burnt  to the ground is where I grew up most of life. Where I raised my 4 year old daughter most of her life before moving up here in North Carolina to be with my Husband who’s currently serving. It hurts to be all the way here in North Carolina and not be able to to do anything for my family. Worrying about where they’re going to go, how are they going live for the time being. If I could fly there I would be there with them right now in a heart beat."

While insurance will be able to help recover some of the losses it will not be able to cover the $100s of thousand we poured into the building to make it what it was. The loss of tools, inventory, and so much more is hard to imagine. The devastating loss of customers' bikes that burned as well as local art and bikes showing the history of the sport were all lost.Finances raised will help keep our two other smaller shops stay in business and stay operational. We have 16 employees that we would like to take care of and keep as many on payroll as possible merging them into 2 stores. We will also use donations to help cover employees' personal items, cars, bikes and other belongings lost in the fire. As well as relocation assistance. Financially with all the refunds and struggles ahead, we could end upside down, but our passion and drive will remain strong and we will push forward."

Up until the recent fire, 8 family members ranging in ages 20 through 62 resided here. Our once family home, our gathering place, is now completely destroyed and burnt to ashes. In a panicked effort to reach safe grounds, our dad and sister lost all of their belongings, important documents and identification, as well as money they had been saving; having just only a few pair of clothes left to start anew. Your donation, no matter how big or small, will help ease their inevitable burdens. All donations received will go towards securing temporary shelter, basic necessities and rebuilding. We are eternally grateful for any support you're able, whether through contributions, sharing on social media and/or continued prayers."

The power had already been out since early that morning due to the high winds knocking down trees and power lines. We had all been hunkering down for the storm. We grabbed what clothes we could and packed into 3 cars. My mother, Anne, my 3 children (aged 3, 5, and 14) and I got stuck in the middle of the fire during evacuation and spent 2 hours watching the fire catch up to us and burn houses a sidewalks distance from our cars while stuck in bumper to bumper traffic.

We need money for everything from clothing, people and pet food, essentials, housing, school supplies, toys, and all the things for daily living.

While they did not have the opportunity to evacuate any of their belongings, they are safe and staying with family as this tragedy unfolds. The Borromeos have a son, Kaleb, who is attending the University of Las Vegas as he pursues his dream of becoming a chiropractor."

After not having internet and phone service all day they did not know the severity of the situation until the gas station across the street from their house exploded. She was able to grab her phone and wallet but left with only the clothes on her back. They were able to escape by car to the bypass but when the fires got too close they were told to leave by police. Unfortunately the car wouldn't start and they were forced to run by foot from the thick black clouds and crazy winds. Thankfully a stranger picked her up and drove her to Wailuku where she is staying with a friend. I know there are so many resources and amazing people donating clothes and food but my mom is in America with a green card and it is critical that she get a new passport. So the money donated will be used for basic necessities as well as making sure she is able to get a new passport."

It is with heavy hearts and shock that the apartment of Eden Rivero and her 5 young boys, Marley, Antonio, Silas, Ola, and Romeo, has been lost due to the fires that ravished Lahaina on 8/8/2023. Their apartment was completely burnt to the ground, and they have lost everything they own, and thankfully with immense help from first responders, they were evacuated and are now safe. Because of this trajedy, Eden is currently without a home, and also without a job. The coffee shop she was working at, was also completely destroyed, leaving her without a job to provide for her boys as a single mama. If you know Eden, you know she is one of the most hard working moms and loves her boys with all of her soul! We are praying for a miracle for her to get the help she needs. Please, if you find it in your hearts to be able to donate anything you can, we are looking to raise enough funds to support her housing for the next 6 months to a year, beds, furniture, food, cost of transportation to and from school for the boys, counseling and trauma care.

Jillian is 41 and this pregnancy is a dream that has been a long time coming. They were so ready with everything perfect for the baby's arrival. Yesterday in the torrential Maui fire their home and belongings burned to ashes. They are pregnant and homeless. They didn't have much time and could only gather a few things. Their rental insurance recently canceled them for being too close to the ocean and they hadn't yet found a company that would insure them. For now, they are staying in a temporary shelter provided by friends until the baby arrives. Joel's newly started business burned, and his tools are gone. His parents home burned to the ground, and they have an autistic adult child to care for. His mother's place of work is also gone along with their whole neighborhood and all of Lahaina town. Our family is hurting beyond words. Any amount of money you could contribute would be very helpful and we would all be immensely grateful for your generosity in helping them rebuild their life. We also ask for your prayers for the safe and healthy delivery of this precious new one joining the world in the midst of all of this. We will keep you posted."

On behalf of our Ohana the Steiner’s, Ko’s and Marzon’s we hope you find it in your heart to contribute to help rebuild their lives. Our beautiful Lahaina was destroyed by the catastrophic events that happened on 8/8/23. The fire that ravaged our historic Lahaina Town, has affected the entire community. Homes, cars, jobs, businesses, historic monuments and sadly lives were lost. Like many families our Steiner, Ko, Marzon Ohana (family) are devastated by the significant loss. Many of them lost their homes, vehicles, their livelihood (including businesses). Lahaina was our home, where we grew up, raised families and been a part of this tight knit community for generations. One of the homes lost was built by hand with the community & Habitat for Humanity. Although it was extremely difficult for the world to watch the fire destroy the home we all know and love. We can’t even begin to comprehend what they have been through and continue to go through, as they pick up the pieces and begin to rebuild their lives. Your donations whether big or small will help tremendously and will be used to rebuild the lives of our Steiner, Ko, Marzon Ohana. We ask for your pule (prayer) for not only our Ohana but all of Lahaina. #lahainastrong"

My family's house was near the Lahaina bypass. My mom, niece, sisters, brother in law, and 2 year old nephew were separated during the fires but thankfully, are now all accounted for. They are currently staying in Kahului with friends and relatives but are still trying to recover from shock and after losing everything they have worked so hard for. I am so thankful that they are all safe and the challenge now is to find shelter and rebuild their lives. On behalf of my family, I am helping them fundraise to find housing in the meantime and rebuild what was lost. All funds will go directly to my family for necessities (food, diapers, clothes, etc) and financial needs. Every little thing and anything helps. Mahalo again. From my family to yours, thank you so much."

Sadly we lost everything.My parents have lived in Lahaina for 25+ years and my heart hurts so much to see where I grew up burn to the ground. These are really hard times so any help is really appreciated even if it’s just sharing this with your friends and family. Funds will go towards necessary supplies, clothing, and food and just to help my family get back on their feet and start rebuilding from scratch.We thank everyone so much for all the love and support!"

On August 8, 2023, my family lost the life that we spent over the last 30 years building, disappearing in the wind-fueled flames. I was born and raised in Lahaina right off of Front Street and my family had multiple businesses on Front Street for over 30 years so this tragedy has stripped us from the only life we've ever known. We were forced to leave our belongings, evacuate our home, and watch our home and family business burn into the ground with the rest of Front Street town. As a result of this tragedy, we would greatly appreciate donations of any amount so that my dad (Tien Doan), mom (Amy Doan), brother (Patrick Doan), sister (Celine Doan), and I can get back on our feet. We know that the Maui community will come together to rebuild Lahaina town very soon but until then, I would greatly appreciate it if you could share this post. If you are unable to donate, all I ask is that you pray for the Maui community during this time of loss and healing."

If I had one more moment in my home with my family, what would I have done? I would have had watched my dad enjoy one more beer in the comfort of his own home while he listened to his favorite country music or singing Karaoke and bbq on his grill. I would have praised my moms hard work as she finished a day of gardening. Her garden meant everything to her. I would had cherish her smile one last time, as she walked through her garden after a stressful day of work. I would have encouraged my dad to paint the porch, that he was working so hard to finish. I would have taken a longer look at the photos of my grandparents and reminisced on my childhood. I would have scanned the room and taken in the memories and love that was built in that home. OUR home. "
