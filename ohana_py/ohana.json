Doug attended and graduated from Lahainaluna Highschool, along with both of his children Austin and Amanda. As integrated parts of their community, the Arakawa family is devastated by the loss of not just their belongings, but their neighborhood, and our beloved Lahaina.

Their home on Luakini housed generations of the Mano ʻohana and held many memories and loved ones, some who had passed prior to the fire. The ashes of her husband Larry (Lionel) Mano deceased (2013), and four year old granddaughter Kaiohu Kapu who passed in 2014 is now apart of the land where the house once stood. "

He has lost his home, shaping room/business, and storage unit . In the dash out the door even his hearing aids and glasses were left behind. Can you imagine starting from scratch at 93 years old? As we are all wondering how can we help, this would be a worthy cause to donate to! I hope that the community can kokua and help him to land on his feet. He has shared the stoke with so many surfers with his longboards over the decades that I hope we can all help him now."

He packed up his entire life in Oregon where he grew up and shipped everything that mattered to him over to Maui to start his new chapter. That chapter started roughly when our dad unexpectedly passed away a week after he moved to Hawaii. Shaun began his wedding planning business after returning from Oregon (for our dad's celebration of life) and worked at Foodland Farms in Lahaina before getting a job with HFA (distributing food to stores in Lahaina). When covid hit in 2020, the wedding planning business was put on hold (since no tourists were allowed for so long). Shaun and Laura met in March 2019. Laura had been on Maui for years and is very loved by many in the theater community and works at local schools as a teacher (4th grade the last two years).

My childhood we spent many summers in Lahaina deepening our relationship with aunties, uncles and cousins and learning about our Hawaiian culture and roots; which I am eternally grateful to my parents as well as my aunties and uncles. These are the cousins, aunties and uncles we are wanting to bless."

I never thought I would ever have to do this, but I am starting this gofundme to humbly ask for your help. Our family has been affected by the wildfire that devastated my beloved hometown of Lahaina, Maui on August 8, 2023. Our family home was destroyed in the fire. Our 90 year-old mother Natividad Pascual barely escaped with her life. But thanks to God and many angels, she is still alive and staying here with me in Wailuku. My brother Macario and his family, Karen, Nick and Evan are safe but sheltering at home in Honokowai. They’ve been without power, and phone and cell service have been sporadic since Tuesday. My Mom was evacuated to the Lahaina Civic Center shelter, where she was seen by EMTs for her eye injuries and small burns from the flying embers and ash. There, she was able to be transported by ambulance to Maui Memorial Medical Center where I was able to reunite with her at 3 a.m. Thank God. We truly believe that our Dad in Heaven was protecting our Mom. The Pascual roots are firmly planted in Lahaina and we will never leave. We hope to one day enjoy the bounty from the marungay tree that my Dad planted back in 1969. The base of the tree still appears to be there – I am confident that it will recover as will our family and all of Lahaina. We appreciate anything you can give. Mahalo and thank you!"

Many of my 2nd and 3rd cousins are like brothers and sisters to me. When situations like these happen, it's only natural for our family to come together to help support our loved ones. My aunty, Kanoe Keahi, lived across the street from the Lahaina Cannery, about a neighborhood over from Lahainaluna road. Her house, like so many others, was decimated in flames. Her dog wasn't able to get out and all they have are the clothes on their backs and they are currently houseless. With that being said, this go fund me is dedicated to her and her Ohana to help on this long road of rebuilding their lives. Full transparency, money raised here will be given directly to her. I've already started collecting donations of all sorts to send help directly to our family currently stuck in Lahaina. Friends of mine were generous enough to donate monetarily and I've personally collected nearly $1800 and counting via Venmo, that will be donated directly to my Aunty to help in getting her and her family clothes and necessities and long term help to get their lives figured out."

My name is Bobi Cuddihy and my brother Sanford Hill lost everything but the clothes on his back and his car in the Lahaina wildfire. Especially hard for him to lose was a lifetime of photography. Sanford is a kama'aina (born and raised in Hawaii). He moved to Maui in 1972, as a 20-year-old, when it was an undiscovered remnant of old Hawaii and before Lahaina became a tourist destination. Sanford is resilient and has the ho’omau (ability to persevere) but at his age it isn’t easy to start all over. He didn’t have much and doesn’t need much. He was living just on social security and in the senior low-income housing. But the cost of starting over in Hawaii is high. Your kindness, generosity, and Aloha to this GoFundMe campaign will go directly towards providing Sanford with the essentials – a safe shelter, clothing, food, and the means to start anew. Every dollar raised will play a crucial role in making a difference in rebuilding his life."

It was a beautiful night under the stars in Kapalua. It was nice, but heartbreaking as well. The bits and pieces of information that we received was that Lahaina town was just about gone and that Wahikuli was on fire. As of right now, their immediate necessities are taken care of.  They do have a long road in front of them, as they will need to rebuild.  Their 2 older kids also lost their school.  Kawika lost all his tools and equipment for his custom knife making business.  So all of that will also need to be replaced.  As of right now, they really don't have any idea of what they need, or how much.  "

She is still currently in Lahaina on the west side of Maui where there is very limited access to basic resources. We are hoping and praying that she & the others have access to food, water, and a bed to sleep in.

The skies were dark, and everyone was unable to make clear decisions due to the nature of the event. At this time, they all went into fight or flight mode and had to do what they needed to do to survive. They were able to successfully flee.

I humbly ask on behalf of Aisha and Alisi for your contribution to help them get back on their feet, to allow aisha to be able to purchase a car as her vehicle burned in the fire, to get a roof over their heads, to allow for various essential items in which are needed to comfortably survive."

            "description": "My name is Tom Kitaguchi. I am humbly starting this gofundme in hopes that I can aid my family and help them find some sense of security during this devastating time. My 92 year old mother, Wanda Kitaguchi (pictured in cover photo), was one of the many who lost their home. Left behind was all of her belongings (with the exception of a few essentials/couple pairs of clothes). She evacuated at the last minute alongside my daughter who also left home with close to nothing. It pains me to say that my brother who also resided with them there, Albert Kitaguchi, has still not been located since the night of 8/8. In efforts to look for my brother, my daughter drove through active fire/power lines/thick black smoke with little visibility on two separate occasions the night of the fire, and watched our home engulfed in flames. My mother, Wanda Kitaguchi, immigrated from Japan to Lahaina in 1953, alongside my Lahaina born father, James S. Kitaguchi (departed). So many memories, so much blood, sweat, and tears, countless irreplaceable family photo albums and memorabilia, journals upon journals of daily logs that my mom would write every evening, all of her \"broke da mouth\" recipes she has spent her whole life collecting from different people and places, gone into the ashes and rubble before they even knew it. Beyond the material things, our Wahikuli home held so much more meaning, history, and depth. Funds earned will go toward providing basic essential items, hotel stay costs, and potentially reestablishing their home in the far future."

As an individual and as a company he works tirelessly to support the local people of Maui.  As a result of the Lāhainā Wildfires my father lost a lot personally, including his entire house, his belongings and family. As a company, he now suffers the loss of tools, machinery and a company vehicle that perished. It is a very hard time for everyone right now, but if you have the means to contribute, we would be eternally grateful. "

My brother, his girlfriend and their dog were woken up from the smoke, flames and screams. Very confused and scared, they tried to get out of the area as fast as possible, but were met in gridlock with other vehicles. They barely made it out of the area alive. With no gas and damage to their van, they walked to kaanapali until they kept being told to move out towards Honokowai. They waited for days with no help. With no sleep, food and barely any water, they made a desperate decision to go back on foot to siphon gas from abandoned cars so they could hopefully drive back out to town. There was no warning that the fires were spreading quickly and we’re thankful that they are ok. "

Jac and Andrew bought their home with every penny they had at a young age because they knew they wanted to grow a family in Lahaina. They rolled up their sleeves together, literally, and over the years spent hundreds of hours personally making the house into a \"home.\" After many years of slowly renovating and budget rebuilding, all while growing their family (having 3 children) they finally reached a point where they were comfortable and not sleeping in a construction zone. They entertained visitors and shared their space with many friends and co-workers. They planted a garden, raised chickens, hosted their children's birthdays, and shared the special memories of family life in Lahaina. Their sense of respect and community pride, appreciation for the culture, and knowledge of the land/ocean is astounding. Although Andrew and Jaclyn are safe and surrounded by family and support, I set up this Crowdfund for them, as they are too emotional at the moment. I know they are humble and I know they will use any funds to support themselves,\rtheir children, and/or the community in Lahaina. Their goal right now is to hang on to their burned land without having to foreclose in hopes to rebuild the \"home,\" not the house."

Desperate to find them he attempted to scale the West Maui Mountains but couldn’t get down to them. I spent a lot of time on the phone with Junior and my sister in Honokowai attempting to locate them. The Maui community really mobilized to help reunite them all after a harrowing 48 hours apart. Juniors income, like so many others, depends on tourism and has been completely disrupted. Cambria’s place of business is gone as are their children’s schools. We don’t know how long they’ll be displaced or in what capacity they’ll be able to return- but in the meantime we’re asking for help to carry them while they continue to pay their mortgage, bills, rent, food, clothing, etc.. without an income."

On August 8th my parents were impacted immensely by the wildfires that tore through Lahaina and burnt their house to the ground. My parents lived in south Lahaina on Front st, with our two loving sweet yellow labradors Molly & Dakota. They are mom and daughter ages 9 & 5. My mom ran a wonderful business from home supplying families in need with baby items which is what brought her to Lahaina. She was previously living in Makawao but moved to Lahaina due to how well her business was doing on the west side. The morning the fires broke out my mom was doing business in Kahului trying to get baby seats to a visiting family. They were trying to rush home, but when they reached the Maui ocean center they were met with road closures and traffic making it impossible to get home. They had to sleep on the side of the road & our dogs were home all alone. They were trying to get ahold of neighbors to grab the dogs before evacuating but there was no luck due to cell towers being down. We are really hoping that they got rescued and made it out safely but we will not know until everything is okay to return too. We still have gotten no word whether or not they are safe and are trying to remain hopeful. My parents lost everything, clothes, medicine, food, pictures, and so much more. 100% of the money raised will be going towards my parents to aid them with the rescue of our dogs, medicine, clothing, food, and basic essentials they need."

Maui is being ravaged by wildfires and the town of Lahaina was almost entirely engulfed. Their car exploded, rental house burned to the ground and they lost all of their belongings. The winds from Hurricane Dora caused the fire to rapidly spread through the area and there was no time to even pack a bag before leaving. There is a long road ahead for Kat, her family and the entire community. Funds are needed for food, water, clothing, housing, and rebuilding the town. The goal we set isn’t anywhere near enough but it will help them get through the coming months."

Myleen and Keola has a son that is 7 years old who was just about to start 2nd grade at Princess Nahienaena Elementary. The fire started on Lahainaluna Road which is located down the street near their house.\rThey were not given enough time to grab whatever necessities they could before disaster came and burned down their home as well as many others. However, They were able to evacuate Lahaina safely but was separated from Keola (Dreyson's dad) during evacuation. Keola is safe and is in Napili with a family friend. Myleen and Dreyson are currently staying with me in Kahului for the time being but is in need of a new home and everything in between."

We were all planning to go to Philippines to celebrate their 50th anniversary.  Our home with everything in it. Now that’s all that’s left is our memories. My mama & papa was separated. She was found safe at Maui prep. My papa was no where to be found. We checked every where. My mama was strong enough to tell us her story. They were evacuating from their home on august 8th on front street. They were able to get out of their truck. My mama tried to get my papa over the truck. Due to my papa being partially paralyzed, it was hard for my mama to bring him over. She tried so hard to save my papa. My papa told my mama to go & be safe with her children, grandchildren, & great grandchildren. My mama never wanted to leave his side. My papa was a brave & hero to tell my mama to save her life. I couldn’t imagine what my mama had to go through & witness. She’s one of the strongest women. My mama went through all of this on her birthday"

Together with Grandma Emi, they worked hard over the next decade or so to make it a home and happily welcomed two more sisters (Sarah and Annabelle) with their families from the Phillipines, and Hesard's mother to live with them. At a full house of 10 there was always a lot of life here, a lot of memories made, a lot of memories kept. This was a home and a promise of a new life in America. This was a place to come home to at the end of the day, a place to stay, talk story, and sing karaoke with family, a place to celebrate birthdays and graduations, a place to be together and mourn the loss of loved ones, a place to play with all the family pets, a place to cook and enjoy delectable home cooked meals, and yes during Covid this was a place for school too. This home was full of life. Please, we are asking for help for the whole family to get back up on their feet, to begin again."

Consequently, they need help with food, clothing, medicine, transportation and shelter.

Thank God she was safe with her wonderful caregiver Tu'u on the other side of the island, at the time the fire occurred, but her ongoing treatment is a large financial expense that must be maintained. In 2018 he was awarded the \"Maui Peace Hero\" award for his selfless service to the community of Maui. Not only has he donated his time, talent, energy and resources for the greater good of Maui throughout his past 40+ years of residency, but has also served our country in the US Navy.

The gravity of the situation is immense and tragic, striking all members of the community. In particular, my brother, Jordan, his wife, Tiff, and 1 year old son, Milo were victims of this fire. Luckily all three of them are safe but their whole possessional life has been lost to the fire. The fire not only burned through their neighborhood but burned to the harbor where my brother worked on numerous boats, destroying his entire work. His office, workshop, and his boats have been consumed by the fire. Additionally, his wife who is a professional photographer is now jobless too as the fire has halted tourism and most of her equipment was consumed in the fire. They now must find a way to provide for themselves and their young son, jobless and without a home to return to. Everything has been lost but two suitcases and their lives. The few words here can not fully encompass the devastation that has occurred. The funds raised here will go directly to them, helping to stabilize themselves amid the instability and insecurity disaster brings, as they navigate rebuilding their lives.

Anything can help, we will plan to rebuild, but first, it's one day at a time! Thank you to everyone for reaching out and checking on us. Also, much love to other ohana's in the same situation! We are all in this together. Lahaina Strong! Mahalo Nui Loa to everyone that can help my ohana and me!"

Not only did they lose there house and everything they need but they also loss memories of my deceased great grandma and great grandpa that we can’t get back. When I got a hold of my grandpa he told me he was outside with a carpenter trying to fix up there house when the wind blew him trying to catch his fall, the fire then began to get bigger and bigger as the wind was soooo strong that they could already feel the heat of the fire coming there way, so of course they needed to evacuate ASAP, as they weren’t able to grab what they needed.

The house was erected in the mid-1950s by my late grandfather, Takeo, and it has been the humble home of my family ever since then. In the efforts to evacuate the house promptly, we were unable to secure anything else besides our family members (three elderly and two dogs, as well as my mother, father, and I). In that process, we were unable to secure any personal belongings and were forced to flee Lahaina with little more than the clothes on our backs.

My grandparents house was one of many homes lost, leaving them with only memories. I never imagined the possibility of losing the home I grew up in. It was more than just four walls and a roof; it represented all the sacrifice and obstacles my family overcame when they immigrated here to have a chance at achieving the \"American Dream.\" It was our gathering place, the center of every celebration and milestone we shared as a family, and it was our comfort, the safe space we turned to in times of difficulty. My family has never been one to ask for help, but today I'm asking for your help on their behalf. We need a little bit of hope to start rebuilding. Any donations will go toward providing supplies and housing to my Grandma Leona, Grandpa Meldring, Auntie Noemi “Mimi,” Uncle Medy and little cousin Misha as they rebuild their life."

She is the best mom to her two sweet boys Teo and Taj.  Heidi herself lost her small business and therefore her income. By some miracle her house is standing, but most of the neighborhood was devastated, it may be weeks before the house can be assessed to be determined if will be livable or will need restoration, not to mention the impact to the power and plumbing infrastructure of that neighborhood. The funds will be used for all necessities as she made it out with her children and a few important papers and the clothes on their back, and additionally paying for housing while they are displaced and no income from the business."

This money will go directly to them to help them rebuild their home and lives.The Francis 'Ohana have become integral members of the Lahaina community. Many kids raised in Lahaina know Uncle John as their youth basketball and baseball coach. He was a coach in the community for years and worked at Princess Nahi'ena'ena Elementary School. Aunty Lisa has worked for the Bank of Hawai'i both in the Kahana and Lahaina branches for decades. Jake and Melissa both grew up playing sports and played for their alma mater Lahainaluna High School. If you're lucky enough to know this 'ohana personally, you know that you will never leave their company without sore cheeks from smiling and laughing the entire time. They are some of the most genuine and kind-hearted people I know.Our families were all raised together. We spent many days wreaking havoc in Wahikuli and driving our parents crazy. Though not by blood, the Francis 'ohana is my family. I hope you can find it in your hearts to help these incredible people during this unfathomable time. Anything helps, mahalo nui."

Visitors and locals alike would come through the shop to talk stories, hang out with friends, and learn to surf. Sometimes just to grab a board and paddle out at Breakwall. Kyle took over the business in 2018, and built a culture that prioritized community, caring and friendship. Folks would come from all over and learn to surf with teachers who practice Aloha in every way. When the fires came on August 8, 2023, there was no preparation for the devastation. The shop- ironically an historic building, the old fire station- burned to the ground and reduced to ash. From aerial photos it is clear nothing survived. The employees have lost everything. Most are now homeless and now have lost their livelihoods for the time being. We are thankful that all employees have been accounted for, it is going to be a long road of rebuilding. We learned that Kyle does not have property insurance. He is applying for every federal loan available, but it is not enough. We are devastated that our beloved shop is gone.

Leaving with not much more than the clothes on their backs, my parents were forced to abandon their car on Front Street and seek refuge in the ocean as their car was engulfed in flames with the rest of Lahaina town. By the grace of God, my childhood home is still standing. However, it has been deemed uninhabitable due to biohazards in the air and water. It is now completely inaccessible as our neighborhood is obsolete and blocked off by the National Guard.Kevin and Michelle have lost the life they have worked so hard to create in Lahaina. For the past 25 years, they have served the Lahaina community through their family-owned business, Aina Lahaina Taxi. Those who know them would describe them as dedicated, kind, and hardworking individuals who aim to go above and beyond in serving their guests. In losing their vehicle in the fire, they have lost not only their source of transportation but also our family’s main source of income. The community that Kevin and Michelle dedicated their 25 years of service to is no longer there."

My name is Linda Romo Stonestreet and I as well as my extended Romo family are raising funds to help our Romo family on Maui after the devastation of the Maui Wildfire. Their family home of 55 years was destroyed by the ravaging wildfire that tore through the beautiful town of Lahaina. Uncle Remy, Royale and Randal evacuated quickly and sadly had to leave all of their possessions behind. They were also forced to make the heartbreaking decision to leave behind their family pets that included 9 cats (Chong, Shadow, Ghost, Whisper, Stoney, Meanie, Goldie, Tiny and Nanu), 8 chickens and 2 lovebirds (Rocky and Adrian). If you know our Maui family you know that they are always the life of the party, where at any time any one of them can tell the funniest story, makes us laugh with crazy jokes or entertain us with beautiful voices. We understand that many across the island of Maui are dealing with the devastation so any donation given is greatly appreciated. The funds raised will help provide the family with the means to purchase groceries and all other necessities for day-to-day living. It will also give them peace of mind as they try to sort out how they are going to get through this as they start their search for housing and employment."

This is a difficult time for many that will need to rebuild from scratch. Thank you to those who have reached out in any of the ways. Through some of these correspondences we received requests to set up a GoFundMe to be able to provide Joy and Mike with some assistance. Joy is currently in the hospital suffering from burns and smoke inhalation recieved while waiting for aid from first responders. She watched her car explode and was pelted by glass and shrapnel while in the rough ocean that evening evading the heat from the devastation unfolding before her eyes. This was not an easy feat as she is recovering from recent spinal fusion surgery. Mike had been helping the Napili Point deal with the severe winds when he received the news of the extreme happenings in Lahaina. Putting a financial number on this trama is impossible! Anything you can do to help them rebuild is Most Appreciated!!"

She is one among many who have lost their home, job and livelihood in the structure fire's devastation. Many community members were forced to evacuate their homes with only a few minutes or less to prepare. I am so grateful Emma is safe and non-injured, as she has been visiting me off-island, but it was a long night of no contact with neighbors and friends whose powerlines were destroyed in the fire's wake. We received little-to-no update until very late, only to find out her entire island hometown of Lahaina had been completely burned to ash. She will return with no house, no clothes, no car and a loss of momentos and memories. I'm hoping to source direct funds from the community, family members and friends in order to help Emma replace, rebuild and find ease as she navigates her return home to this tragic loss that has left her with nothing. All money donated will go directly to Emma."

My family has been in Lahaina since 1994 after my parents immigrated from the Phillippines to seek a better life in the U.S. After 30 years of supporting my siblings and me through long hours of arduous back-breaking work in the tourism industry, this disaster has left them without a home, taking everything from our beloved backyard garden to the mailbox at the end of our driveway. They had been so proud to be able to afford a house that they could call theirs, that would serve as a place for so many family reunions for me, my siblings (Len, Nelson, and Rhon) and our young families. Just four months ago we were visiting the people and places that shaped me into who I am today. Those places no longer exist. My mom, Leony, my dad, Leo, and my brother's partner, Haley, were living in the home before the fire and now are left without a place to call home. This nightmare is something we could have never imagined.Any amount that you can contribute will go directly to getting my heartbroken family back on their feet and rebuilding our family home. We thank you from the bottom of our hearts."

Our family has been a part of the Lahaina community for over 30 years, owning a small jewelry shop on Front St for most of that time. Sadly, we had to give up that storefront during the pandemic, and my aunt moved to running her business out of her home. With less than an hour to evacuate, their family was only able to grab their most valuable possessions, leaving behind clothing, merchandise, supplies, documents, and much more. Still recovering from the recent loss of my grandmother who lived with them and anticipating large upcoming college tuition costs for their eldest son, my aunt and her family were already in a tight financial position.

The destruction caused by these fires has left Miles, Eli, and their two small children, Skyler and Mylo without a place to call home. Miles had just spent the last several years updating their house with his own two hands, and now it’s gone. With little time to evacuate, they had to leave behind cherished memories and possessions in order to escape the horrific wildfire. We are beyond thankful that they are safe, but are heartbroken for them. Not only was their house completely destroyed, but their ENTIRE town and livelihoods. Miles and Eli have always been two of the most generous, hospitable people and they (along with so many others) are in need of our support now more than ever. Any donation would make a significant difference. Let’s show them that they are not alone in this devastation."

My mom, stepdad and little sister did not get out of Lahaina until the day after and they could not locate my stepdads parents. They finally found his parents at the shelter. This is actually the second time my mom experienced losing her home to a fire. Back in 2018 she lost her home from a fire in Lahaina. Please help my family. They all left their homes with the clothes on their backs and everything is gone. My mom, little sister, stepdad, grandparents and I need your help and we appreciate any donations and prayers."

With fire nearly trapping the traffic of cars, my family made the quick decision to turn around to go towards Central Maui. With downed traffic lights, power lines, trees, and thick, blinding smoke, we barely made it out of Lahaina. Had we not done this, we would have been among the many people that had to abandon their cars and jump into the ocean for safety. Since coming to Wailuku, photos show that our home and town has turned to rubble. We are grateful to be alive and reunite with my grandparents, whom we didn't locate until a day later. However, we can only fend for ourselves with the money we have in our pockets and banks for so long. The more days that pass, the more our survival becomes a financial burden. Please consider donating any ounce of money to our family. This will go towards hopefully rebuilding our house (whenever that is possible), repurchasing valuables lost in the fire, pet food and supplies, and other necessary items. Thank you for all of the prayers, thoughts, phone calls, and texts. We sincerely appreciate it."

They live in the heart of Lahaina where Dave, Nic, and Thorpe worked at Waikiki Brewing on Front Street. Dave was the executive head chef there, putting his heart and soul into creating the menu from the ground up, and embracing the island foods while adding his own Colorado flare. It was a labor of love that was caught in this horrific event on Wednesday. Melissa has lived on the islands for over ten years and currently works with the Maui, Molokai, and Lanai schools in special education with an emphasis in working with deaf and hard of hearing children often traveling between all three islands. If you know these two, you are aware of how they embody aloha. Friends for almost 20 years, I’ve worked with Melissa, lived with her, and she has become an auntie to my children and pets. They are the kindest and most deserving individuals we know and she would give the shirt off her back for a friend or stranger. Now that they need our help, it’s time to give all that we can to help them get back on their feet and get back to work. Our hearts are broken but we know that this community can come together and rebuild. All funds raised will be given directly to Melissa, Dave, Nic and Thorpe to rebuild their lives and get their animals to safety. Mahalo."

To be able to describe our exodus (and I use biblical words because it’s was really biblical) I would have to remember and right now the best thing is moving forward. We’re safe thank god, with health and most important part we’re together. Now as we tried to recoup and balance our wins and looses we just realized that we might be out of resources kind of quick.

We also ask for our Twin girls Stella and Luna age 5 who we will also need to buy school supplies and clothing, footwear. And most inpostantly food and drinking water.

It was only towards the bottom, a very generous couple (to whom there will never be enough words to express how forever grateful my family is to you) let them into their vehicle and led them to safety. After when everything is said and done, my Aunty and uncle will have nothing to go back to; their working place, which also was lost to the fire, but more importantly, a home. The house they called home was home to many other families who rented, most of whom didn’t even know what renters insurance was.

They couldn't even get back to get their precious dog, Denali. Their vehicle was also lost in the fire while it was parked in the driveway. Their current jobs are burned to the ground. We’re very glad they’re safe, but we want to do everything we can to make this terrible situation as easy as possible. I know Brendan and his wife, Samm, love their friends and community and will use these funds to help others in need as well."

They are with friends while they try to navigate next steps. Rebuilding will be a long road and they are going to need our prayers, positive vibes, and resources to help get them through this terrible time. The funds we raise will go directly to The Burns Fam to assist with basic necessities (food, water, toiletries, clothing), transportation (including flights off the island should they deem it necessary), and of course the costs involved in rebuilding their home / life.Greg nor Sarah have asked for help, as that is just who they are! Fighters who will always get back up when they get knocked down, but like any friend who is down - we can all use a springboard to help us up! Please consider a donation in any amount to help an amazing family know they are loved, supported, and so they can continue to live their dream through an immensely difficult time!"

She was able to grab her phone and wallet but left with only the clothes on her back. They were able to escape by car to the bypass but when the fires got too close they were told to leave by police. Unfortunately the car wouldn't start and they were forced to run by foot from the thick black clouds and crazy winds. Thankfully a stranger picked her up and drove her to Wailuku where she is staying with a friend. I know there are so many resources and amazing people donating clothes and food but my mom is in America with a green card and it is critical that she get a new passport. So the money donated will be used for basic necessities as well as making sure she is able to get her paperwork in order."

The loss of tools, inventory, and so much more is hard to imagine. The devastating loss of customers' bikes that burned as well as local art and bikes showing the history of the sport were all lost.Finances raised will help keep our two other smaller shops stay in business and stay operational. We have 16 employees that we would like to take care of and keep as many on payroll as possible merging them into 2 stores. We will also use donations to help cover employees' personal items, cars, bikes and other belongings lost in the fire. As well as relocation assistance. Financially with all the refunds and struggles ahead, we could end upside down, but our passion and drive will remain strong and we will push forward."

Unfortunately, nothing survived the horrific fires, and they are left with the small duffel bags that they managed to pack en route to evacuating. We know that hundreds and thousands are also going through this same nightmare, but we are appreciative of all those who are willing to offer some help, support, and relief."

Myself and Auntie Maria were not home at the time of the evacuation but thankfully my mama Joy, my father Marlon, Uncle Rene, Auntie Nora and my Uncle Taylor made it out just in time. This house was not only a home to me, but to everyone. Many of my aunties and uncles grew up in this house under the care of my mama and late papa. They've opened their doors to many friends and family as a sanctuary for those who needed it. Although not expected any monetary relief will be greatly appreciated by my ohana, as we all are going through a very difficult and tragic time."

We grabbed what clothes we could and packed into 3 cars. My mother, Anne, my 3 children (aged 3, 5, and 14) and I got stuck in the middle of the fire during evacuation and spent 2 hours watching the fire catch up to us and burn houses a sidewalks distance from our cars while stuck in bumper to bumper traffic.

Satellite imagery shows that their Lahainaluna home has been burned to the ground - and neighbors were able to confirm there is nothing left but a concrete slab where the house once stood. While they did not have the opportunity to evacuate any of their belongings, they are safe and staying with family as this tragedy unfolds. The Borromeos have a son, Kaleb, who is attending the University of Las Vegas as he pursues his dream of becoming a chiropractor."

After not having internet and phone service all day they did not know the severity of the situation until the gas station across the street from their house exploded. She was able to grab her phone and wallet but left with only the clothes on her back. They were able to escape by car to the bypass but when the fires got too close they were told to leave by police. Unfortunately the car wouldn't start and they were forced to run by foot from the thick black clouds and crazy winds. Thankfully a stranger picked her up and drove her to Wailuku where she is staying with a friend. I know there are so many resources and amazing people donating clothes and food but my mom is in America with a green card and it is critical that she get a new passport. So the money donated will be used for basic necessities as well as making sure she is able to get a new passport."

Unfortunately they were unable to grab any of their belongings before evacuating from the wildfires, and the wildfire ended up taking their home and all of their belongings along with it. Lauren and Sherwin are most concerned for their boys who are in need of clothing, shoes, and toys. Any help you might be able to offer their family in providing these essentials for them and their children they would be forever grateful for. I can’t imagine what they are feeling, and thank you so much for helping us help them in whatever way you can!"

Yesterday in the torrential Maui fire their home and belongings burned to ashes. They are pregnant and homeless. They didn't have much time and could only gather a few things. Their rental insurance recently canceled them for being too close to the ocean and they hadn't yet found a company that would insure them. For now, they are staying in a temporary shelter provided by friends until the baby arrives. Joel's newly started business burned, and his tools are gone. His parents home burned to the ground, and they have an autistic adult child to care for. His mother's place of work is also gone along with their whole neighborhood and all of Lahaina town. Our family is hurting beyond words. Any amount of money you could contribute would be very helpful and we would all be immensely grateful for your generosity in helping them rebuild their life.

Luckily she was in Vietnam to handle our grandma's memorial service. I would like to organize some funds to be sent directly to her. She, my parents, and my family have been a part of the community for over 30 years. My family was well known in the town as taxi drivers, nail shop workers, and massage therapists and I myself graduated from Lahainaluna back in '11. It would mean a lot to be able to get some exposure to my aunt."

Our beautiful Lahaina was destroyed by the catastrophic events that happened on 8/8/23. The fire that ravaged our historic Lahaina Town, has affected the entire community. Homes, cars, jobs, businesses, historic monuments and sadly lives were lost. Like many families our Steiner, Ko, Marzon Ohana (family) are devastated by the significant loss. Many of them lost their homes, vehicles, their livelihood (including businesses). Lahaina was our home, where we grew up, raised families and been a part of this tight knit community for generations. One of the homes lost was built by hand with the community & Habitat for Humanity. Although it was extremely difficult for the world to watch the fire destroy the home we all know and love. We can’t even begin to comprehend what they have been through and continue to go through, as they pick up the pieces and begin to rebuild their lives. Your donations whether big or small will help tremendously and will be used to rebuild the lives of our Steiner, Ko, Marzon Ohana. We ask for your pule (prayer) for not only our Ohana but all of Lahaina. #lahainastrong"

I was born and raised in Lahaina right off of Front Street and my family had multiple businesses on Front Street for over 30 years so this tragedy has stripped us from the only life we've ever known. We were forced to leave our belongings, evacuate our home, and watch our home and family business burn into the ground with the rest of Front Street town. As a result of this tragedy, we would greatly appreciate donations of any amount so that my dad (Tien Doan), mom (Amy Doan), brother (Patrick Doan), sister (Celine Doan), and I can get back on our feet. We know that the Maui community will come together to rebuild Lahaina town very soon but until then, I would greatly appreciate it if you could share this post.

If I had one more moment in my home with my family, what would I have done? I would have had watched my dad enjoy one more beer in the comfort of his own home while he listened to his favorite country music or singing Karaoke and bbq on his grill. I would have praised my moms hard work as she finished a day of gardening. Her garden meant everything to her. I would had cherish her smile one last time, as she walked through her garden after a stressful day of work. I would have encouraged my dad to paint the porch, that he was working so hard to finish. I would have taken a longer look at the photos of my grandparents and reminisced on my childhood. I would have scanned the room and taken in the memories and love that was built in that home. OUR home. "
