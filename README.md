ðŸ“„ Visit the master spreadsheet created by [@kennareed](https://www.instagram.com/kennareed/) [@ssamakaio](https://www.instagram.com/ssamakaio/) [@gwubby](https://www.instagram.com/gwubby/): [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lExatubPl6zvsDcy4qUd3Sv1PvvKrzMhUyOzaKuId0o/htmlview

A website tool to directly Aid Ê»Ohana Displaced by Maui Fires. This website randomly pairs you with a family to directly support from [this list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lExatubPl6zvsDcy4qUd3Sv1PvvKrzMhUyOzaKuId0o/htmlview).

Please note: The information is currently pulled from the Google sheet manually using a python script `/ohana_py/scraper.py`. The python script creates a local API at `/ohana_py/ohana.json`. This is due to Google's API restrictions and also keeps the site fast.

Feel free to add issues or pull requests to this repo.

This tool was only possible with the incredible work [@kennareed](https://www.instagram.com/kennareed/) [@ssamakaio](https://www.instagram.com/ssamakaio/) [@gwubby](https://www.instagram.com/gwubby/) have been doing.

Please repost [mauiohana.support](http://mauiohana.support) everywhere. If you want to give credit, please @ the original creators of the spreadsheet, not me. Let's get these families direct support. Mahalo nui loa.
